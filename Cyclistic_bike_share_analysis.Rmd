##### CYCLISTIC_BIKE_SHARE_ANALYSIS_REPORT

## BUSINESS TASK

   The Cyclistic marketing team wants to better understand how annual members and casual riders use the bike-sharing service differently.

   The goal is to identify behavioral trends and usage patterns that will help **convert more casual riders into annual members**, **increasing customer retention** and **overall revenue**.


## DATA SOURCES
```{r}
# Upload Divvy datasets (csv files) here
q1_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv")
q1_2020 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")
```

## CLEANING AND MANIPULATION
```{r}
# Rename columns in q1_2019 to match q1_2020
q1_2019 <- rename(q1_2019,
  ride_id = trip_id,
  rideable_type = bikeid,
  started_at = start_time,
  ended_at = end_time,
  start_station_name = from_station_name,
  start_station_id = from_station_id,
  end_station_name = to_station_name,
  end_station_id = to_station_id,
  member_casual = usertype
)

# Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character for stacking
q1_2019 <- mutate(q1_2019,
  ride_id = as.character(ride_id),
  rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)
)
```

```{r}
# Stack datasets
all_trips <- bind_rows(q1_2019, q1_2020)
```

```{r}
# View structure and initial rows
str(all_trips)
head(all_trips)
colnames(all_trips)
```

```{r}
# Safely remove unwanted columns
all_trips <- all_trips %>% 
  select(-any_of(c("start_lat", "start_lng", "end_lat", "end_lng", "birthyear", "gender", "tripduration")))
```

```{r}
# Standardize member_casual values if needed
all_trips <- all_trips %>% 
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual,
                                "Subscriber" = "member",
                                "Customer" = "casual"))
```

```{r}
# Add date components
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at)
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")
```

```{r}
# Add ride_length column
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at, all_trips$started_at)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
```

```{r}
# Remove bad data
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length < 0),]
```

## ANALYSIS
```{r}
# Descriptive stats
summary(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
```

```{r}
# Compare user types
all_trips_v2 %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(ride_length),
    median = median(ride_length),
    max = max(ride_length),
    min = min(ride_length)
  )
```

```{r}
# Average ride time by weekday
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

```{r}
# Grouped summary by weekday
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%

```

## ✅ INSIGHTS
- **Casual users** ride significantly more during **weekends**, and their **average ride durations** are longer. This indicates a strong **leisure or recreational use case**.

- **Members** ride more consistently on **weekdays**, with shorter trips, suggesting usage for **commuting or utility travel**.

---

### 📈 Data-Driven Recommendations

- 🎯 **Targeted Promotions**:  
  Launch **weekend offers, discounts, or scenic ride packages** aimed at casual users to encourage continued usage and convert some to members.

- 🧳 **Commuter Perks for Members**:  
  Introduce **weekday loyalty programs** or **morning rush hour discounts** for members to reward regular usage.

- 📅 **Seasonal Campaigns**:  
  Monthly ride patterns show that **spring and summer months** have the highest usage, especially among casual riders.  
  Plan **seasonal marketing pushes** (e.g., summer pass, holiday ride challenges) to capitalize on peak demand.

- ⏱️ **Duration-Based Pricing Adjustments**:  
  Since casual users take longer rides, ensure **price tiers** or **time-based billing** models encourage them to upgrade or ride more efficiently.

- 🧭 **User Education & Onboarding**:  
  Members tend to have shorter rides — possibly due to familiarity. Providing **onboarding tips for casual users** may help improve their confidence and trip planning.

---

## CONCLUSION
  This analysis provides clear evidence of different usage behaviors between Cyclistic’s casual and member riders. The recommendations aim to optimize **user experience**, **improve marketing effectiveness**, and **support strategic membership growth**.
